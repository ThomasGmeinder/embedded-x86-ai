"""Component 3 self-test harness (PROVIDED) - run: ``python -m integration.selftest``

Exercises YOUR integration wiring end-to-end with synthetic backends - a
synthetic camera, a scripted "person" (pose) and hand source, and a dry-run
arm - so the whole compose-and-dispatch path runs with ZERO hardware: no NPU,
no ROS 2, no llama-server, no webcam.

What it checks, per component-3 TODO:

- **3.1 build_registry** - the four behaviors are registered to the right
  handlers (and STOP deliberately is NOT - it's an interrupt, not a behavior).
- **3.2 handle_transcript** - the safety gauntlet in order: the stop fast
  path (sets the stop event, bypasses the parser), the noise gate (drops
  Whisper's silence hallucinations before the LLM), normal dispatch, and the
  stop-event hygiene that keeps a stale stop from killing the next behavior.
- **3.3 mimic_tick** - one camera frame → pose + hands → mapper → a full,
  clamped arm command; it follows the NEAREST person (largest box) and
  honors the grip lock so a held object stays held.
- **3.4 run_dance** - beat-paced choreography that stays stoppable and
  always parks at the rest pose.

The on-hardware equivalent - real camera, NPU pose, ROS 2 arm, Llama brain -
is the live UI itself:

    python app.py --dry-run --synthetic --no-llm     # laptop / CI
    python app.py                                    # the rig

Every check reports PASS / FAIL / TODO / SKIP with a pointer, so a fresh
project prints a clean 3.1-3.4 TODO list instead of a stack trace.
