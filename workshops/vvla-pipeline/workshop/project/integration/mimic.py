"""Gesture mimic - the workshop's flagship composition.

One tick of mimic is the whole pipeline in miniature:

    camera frame ──► YOLO-pose (NPU) ──► wrist x/y + forearm ─┐
                └──► MediaPipe (CPU) ──► size/roll/pinch ─────┤──► mapper ──► arm
                                                              │  (provided)  (ROS 2)
                     shared grip-lock state ──────────────────┘

On a REAL arm the mimic session runs against LIVE_MIMIC_LIMITS - the base
envelope extended 25% (gripper excluded) - and restores the base
JOINT_LIMITS on exit; dry-run/synthetic stays on the base limits.

Everything around the tick - the loop, the preview window, the HUD that
attributes each joint to the TODO that feeds it - is provided. The tick
itself, the line where model outputs become robot motion, is yours.

       a wrist AND its elbow with :func:`common.imaging.pick_arm` (threshold:

       hand_size / roll_ti / roll_ref / roll_ti_weight / roll / pinch.
    3. Grip-lock: if ``ctx.shared_state['grip_lock']`` is set, pass
       ``ctx.shared_state['grip_lock_pos']`` as ``gripper_override`` so a
       held object stays held while the arm mimics.
    4. ``ctx.mapper.step(...)`` with everything from 1-3 (pass the elbow as
       ``elbow_xy=`` - wrist_flex measures your hand's direction against it
       to read the WRIST BEND; without it the forearm is assumed vertical)
       → a clamped joint dict - then ``ctx.arm.send_joints(joints)``.
       If NEITHER a wrist NOR a hand was seen, send nothing (hold pose).

    Return a :class:`MimicSignals` with everything you used - the HUD shows
    your work. Keep the RAW results from ``ctx.hands.process`` too (the
    ``raw`` field) so the UI can draw the MediaPipe hand overlay.
