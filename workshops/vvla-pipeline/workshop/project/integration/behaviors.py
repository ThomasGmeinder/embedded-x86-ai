"""Simple behaviors: dance (your TODO), wave and home (the provided template).

``run_wave``/``run_home`` are the canonical shape of a behavior handler:
``(ctx, cmd)`` in, motion through ``ctx.arm``, ``ctx.stop_check`` polled so a
spoken "stop" interrupts mid-move, park at the end. ``run_dance`` is the
same shape with a beat clock - the choreography (:data:`common.motion.
DANCE_MOVES`) is a provided static asset; the control flow is the exercise.

Notebook: ``notebooks/03_integration/01_behavior.ipynb``
Harness:  ``python app.py --dry-run --synthetic`` (then type ``dance``)

    Read ``dance.bpm`` and ``dance.duration_s`` from ``ctx.cfg`` (honor the

    move order (:data:`~common.motion.DANCE_MOVES`), then cycle through it;
    play each move's keyframes ×4 with ``ctx.arm.go_to(keyframe,
