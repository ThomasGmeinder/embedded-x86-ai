"""Command intents, registry, and noise gate (PROVIDED).

These are the pipeline's *static assets*: the intent vocabulary, the system
prompt that steers the LLM, the stop keywords, and the noise-phrase filter.
They are provided because they would be copy-paste in any implementation -
the interesting work is *wiring them up* (see ``models/llm.py``,
``ros/intent_node.py``, and ``integration/dispatch.py``).

- "gesture_mimic": the user wants the arm to copy / mirror / follow their own
  arm and hand movements ("copy me", "mirror my hand", "follow my arm").
- "fetch_block": the user wants the block/cube from its usual spot brought to
  them ("get me the block", "bring the cube here").
- "pick_place": the user names an object to pick up / grab / hand over
  ("pick up the ball", "grab the bottle and give it to me"). Put the object
  name in "object".
- "dance": the user wants the robot to dance / groove / party.
- "grip": the user is handing the robot something to hold ("hold this",

- "wave": the user wants a wave / greeting ("wave at me", "say hi").
- "home": return to the rest/home position ("go home", "reset position",
