"""Benign-noise hushing (PROVIDED) - every notebook calls hush_benign_warnings().

The workshop stack is chatty in ways that LOOK like problems but aren't:
MediaPipe's C++ glog/absl init lines, Mesa's libEGL DRI3 probe warnings,
onnxruntime's "some nodes were not assigned to the preferred execution
provider" (expected when the VitisAI EP partitions a graph), and a
dual-matplotlib Axes3D import quirk. Real errors still come through - only
the known-benign chatter is filtered.
