"""Command intents shared by the LLM parser, orchestrator, and behaviors.

This revision makes the command set **extensible**: a command is an
``Intent`` plus a parameter dict (``ParsedCommand``), and behaviors register
themselves on a :class:`CommandRegistry` instead of being hardcoded in the
orchestrator's dispatch. Adding a new voice command =

1. add the enum member + one line in :data:`INTENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`,
2. add its name to ``config/intent.gbnf``'s ``cmd`` rule,
3. decorate a handler with ``@registry.register(Intent.MY_COMMAND)``.

``STOP`` is special: the orchestrator matches it with plain keywords on the
raw transcript (no LLM round trip) so the safety stop is as fast as possible,
and it interrupts any running behavior via the shared stop event.
