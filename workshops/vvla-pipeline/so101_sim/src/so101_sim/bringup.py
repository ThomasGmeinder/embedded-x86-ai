"""DDS participant before any Vitis AI session.

``run_pipeline.sh`` and ``run_notebooks.sh`` both start their Python process
with this module. ``FASTDDS_BUILTIN_TRANSPORTS=LARGE_DATA`` does not discover
peers when a Vitis AI session is opened first, and ``rclpy.init`` alone does
not create a participant. This module creates one, then runs the pipeline or
the notebook kernel.

The notebook kernel is pinned to the twin's domain (``TWIN_ROS_DOMAIN_ID``,
else 87) with discovery kept on this machine. The pipeline keeps the domain
its launches are already using.
