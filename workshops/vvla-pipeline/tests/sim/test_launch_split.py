"""run_pipeline.sh starts the cameras and the arm as two ``ros2 launch`` runs.

One launch ends everything in it when one of its parts raises. A missing xacro
in the arm's part therefore took the camera nodes down with it. The arm is
made to fail here with a stand-in ``xacro`` package that raises on import; the
real ``strix_vla.launch.py`` runs unchanged.
